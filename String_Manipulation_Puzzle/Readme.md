Coding Challenge: String Manipulation Puzzle

You are given a string containing only lowercase English letters. Your task is to manipulate the string using the following operations:

1. Reverse: Reverse the entire string.

2. Swap: Swap the characters at positions i and j.

3. Shift: Shift the string k positions to the right. The k rightmost characters move to the leftmost positions, and the rest of the characters move to the right k positions.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string into a target string.

Write a function that takes the following input:

Input:
- initialString (string): The initial string containing only lowercase English letters with a length up to 100.
- targetString (string): The target string containing only lowercase English letters with a length up to 100.

Output:
- int: The minimum number of operations required to transform the initial string into the target string. If transformation is not possible, return -1.

Example:
Input: initialString = "abcdef", targetString = "fedcba"
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible sequence of operations is: Reverse -> Swap(1, 2) -> Shift(3).

Input: initialString = "abc", targetString = "def"
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to transform "abc" into "def" using the defined operations.

Notes:
- The initial string and target string will contain only lowercase English letters.
- The function should have a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string.
- You may use any programming language to solve the problem.
- Provide test cases to demonstrate the correctness of your solution.
