## The Linear Algebra Equation Solver

You are given a system of linear equations represented as `n` equations with `m` variables. Each equation is in the form of `ax + by + cz + ... = d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, ... are the coefficients of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, ..., and `d` is a constant.

Your task is to implement the function `solveLinearEquations` that finds the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, ... that satisfy all the given equations.

Your function should return a list of `m` values representing the solution to the system of equations. If there are multiple solutions or no solution, return an empty list.

### Example

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        double[,] equations = new double[,]
        {
            { 2, 3, 1, 4 },
            { 1, -1, 2, 1 },
            { 3, 2, -1, 8 }
        };

        double[] solution = SolveLinearEquations(equations);
        // Output: [1, 2, 3]
        // The solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, z = 3.
    }

    public static double[] SolveLinearEquations(double[,] equations)
    {
        // Implement your solution here
    }
}
