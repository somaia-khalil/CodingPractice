## The Rubik's Cube Solver

You are given a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube represented as a 3-dimensional array of colors. Each face of the cube is represented by a 2-dimensional array of colors (front, back, left, right, top, and bottom faces).

Your task is to implement the function `SolveRubiksCube` that solves the Rubik's cube by rearranging the colors of the cube faces.

The function should take the following inputs:

- A 3-dimensional array representing the colors of the cube faces. The colors are represented by single characters, where 'R' is red, 'G' is green, 'B' is blue, 'Y' is yellow, 'W' is white, and 'O' is orange.

The function should return a list of moves to solve the Rubik's cube. Each move is represented by a string with the format "face_direction" where "face" is one of the face names (F, B, L, R, U, D) and "direction" is one of the directions (clockwise ' or counterclockwise '). For example, "F'" means rotating the front face counterclockwise.

### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        char[,,] cube = new char[3, 3, 3]
        {
            {
                { 'R', 'R', 'G' },
                { 'Y', 'G', 'G' },
                { 'R', 'B', 'B' }
            },
            {
                { 'W', 'W', 'G' },
                { 'R', 'O', 'O' },
                { 'Y', 'G', 'B' }
            },
            {
                { 'Y', 'W', 'O' },
                { 'W', 'R', 'B' },
                { 'B', 'Y', 'O' }
            }
        };

        List<string> moves = SolveRubiksCube(cube);
        // Output: ["F'", "U'", "L'", "U'", "B'", "B'", "L'", "L'", "U'", "L'", "L'", "F'", "U'", "L'", "U'", "B'", "B'", "L'"]
        // Explanation: The moves represent a sequence to solve the Rubik's cube.

        // Apply the moves to the initial cube to solve it:
        ApplyMoves(cube, moves);
        // The cube is now solved.
    }

    public static List<string> SolveRubiksCube(char[,,] cube)
    {
        // Implement your solution here
    }

    private static void ApplyMoves(char[,,] cube, List<string> moves)
    {
        // Helper function to apply the moves to the cube
    }
}
