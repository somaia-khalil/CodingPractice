## Sudoku Solver

Write a function `sudokuSolver` to solve a given Sudoku puzzle.

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Your task is to implement the function `sudokuSolver` that takes a 2D array representing the Sudoku puzzle as input, with empty cells represented by 0, and modifies the original array to solve the puzzle.

### Example

```js
const puzzle = [
  [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
  [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
];

sudokuSolver(puzzle);
// `puzzle` will be modified to the solved Sudoku.

console.log(puzzle);
// Output:
// [
//   [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
//   [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
//   [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
//   [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
//   [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
//   [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
//   [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
//   [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
//   [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]
// ]
