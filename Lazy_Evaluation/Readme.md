## The Complex Lazy Evaluation Challenge

You are given a data stream containing complex numbers. Your task is to implement a class `ComplexStreamProcessor` that performs lazy evaluation on the data stream and provides various operations on the complex numbers.

### Class: ComplexStreamProcessor

#### Properties:

1. `DataStream` (IEnumerable<Complex>): A private IEnumerable representing the data stream of complex numbers.

#### Methods:

1. `Take`: A public method that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the first `n` complex numbers from the data stream. The method should perform lazy evaluation and return the result as an IEnumerable<Complex>.

2. `Where`: A public method that takes a predicate function as input and returns a filtered data stream that satisfies the predicate. The method should perform lazy evaluation and return the result as an IEnumerable<Complex>.

3. `Select`: A public method that takes a selector function as input and returns a data stream with each element transformed by the selector function. The method should perform lazy evaluation and return the result as an IEnumerable<Complex>.

4. `Aggregate`: A public method that takes an aggregation function as input and returns a single complex number that is the result of applying the aggregation function to the data stream. The method should perform lazy evaluation and return the result as a Complex.

### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Sample data stream containing complex numbers
        IEnumerable<Complex> dataStream = new List<Complex>
        {
            new Complex(1, 2),
            new Complex(3, 4),
            new Complex(5, 6),
            new Complex(7, 8)
        };

        // Create the ComplexStreamProcessor with the data stream
        ComplexStreamProcessor processor = new ComplexStreamProcessor(dataStream);

        // Take the first 3 complex numbers from the data stream
        IEnumerable<Complex> first3 = processor.Take(3);

        // Filter the complex numbers that satisfy the predicate: Re > 3
        IEnumerable<Complex> filtered = processor.Where(c => c.Re > 3);

        // Transform each complex number: z -> z^2
        IEnumerable<Complex> transformed = processor.Select(c => c * c);

        // Find the sum of all complex numbers in the data stream
        Complex sum = processor.Aggregate((acc, c) => acc + c);
    }
}
