## Largest Sum of Non-Adjacent Numbers

Given an array of integers, find the largest sum that can be obtained by selecting a subset of non-adjacent numbers.

Your task is to implement the function `largestNonAdjacentSum` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent numbers.

### Example

```js
largestNonAdjacentSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // Output: 9 (as 2 + 4 is the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers)
largestNonAdjacentSum([3, 2, 7, 10]);   // Output: 13 (as 3 + 10 is the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers)
