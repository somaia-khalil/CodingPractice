## The Cryptic Code Challenge

You are given a cryptic piece of code that you need to decipher. The code consists of a short sequence of characters. Your task is to figure out the hidden message by reverse-engineering the logic used in the code.

### Cryptic Code

ftqsknlx


### Hints

1. The code does not use any common encryption algorithms.
2. The solution is based on a simple and unique pattern.

### Constraints

- The length of the cryptic code will be between 8 to 10 characters.
- The hidden message will be a string of meaningful words.

### Example

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string crypticCode = "ftqsknlx";
        string message = DecryptCode(crypticCode);
        Console.WriteLine("Hidden Message: " + message);
    }

    static string DecryptCode(string code)
    {
        // Your decryption logic here
    }
}
