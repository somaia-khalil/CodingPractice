## The Performance-Critical Challenge

You are given a large collection of strings representing sentences. Your task is to implement a class `SentenceProcessor` that provides efficient methods to perform various operations on the sentences.

### Class: SentenceProcessor

#### Properties:

1. `Sentences` (List<string>): A private list of strings representing sentences.

#### Methods:

1. `LongestSentence`: A public method that finds and returns the longest sentence from the collection. The method should be optimized for performance and should avoid unnecessary string operations.

2. `CountOccurrences`: A public method that takes a word as input and returns the total number of occurrences of that word in all the sentences. The method should be optimized for performance and avoid redundant searches.

3. `MostFrequentWords`: A public method that returns a list of the 'k' most frequently occurring words across all sentences, ordered by frequency. The method should be optimized for performance, especially for large collections.

4. `DistinctWordCount`: A public method that calculates and returns the total count of unique words across all sentences. The method should be optimized to minimize memory usage and avoid duplicate storage.

### Constraints:

- The number of sentences in the collection can be very large (up to 10^6 sentences).
- Each sentence can contain up to 100 words, and each word can have a maximum length of 50 characters.

### Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<string> sentences = new List<string>
        {
            "This is a sample sentence.",
            "The cat in the hat.",
            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            // ... (many more sentences)
        };

        SentenceProcessor processor = new SentenceProcessor(sentences);

        string longestSentence = processor.LongestSentence();
        Console.WriteLine($"Longest Sentence: {longestSentence}");

        int wordOccurrences = processor.CountOccurrences("cat");
        Console.WriteLine($"Occurrences of 'cat': {wordOccurrences}");

        int k = 5;
        List<string> mostFrequentWords = processor.MostFrequentWords(k);
        Console.WriteLine($"Most frequent {k} words: {string.Join(", ", mostFrequentWords)}");

        int distinctWordCount = processor.DistinctWordCount();
        Console.WriteLine($"Distinct Word Count: {distinctWordCount}");
    }
}
