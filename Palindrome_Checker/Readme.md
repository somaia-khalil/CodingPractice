## Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "racecar" and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" are both palindromes.

Your task is to write a function `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if it is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

### Example

```js
isPalindrome("racecar"); // Output: true
isPalindrome("hello");   // Output: false
